# Public Startpage Demo

the project originally only held 1 startpage, which is now located in the zt_original folder, 
since i made that a few years ago and i've gotten a lot more comfortable with WebDev i've decided to expand
the project a bit, including more examples of potential start-pages, consider this a WebDesign portfolio

### What is a startpage?

a startpage is a "locally hosted" (usually just a .html file stored on the device and accesed by a filepath) 
html page that serves as the "homepage" for your browser, this is the page that
first opens when you launch your browser, and could be the default page for new tabs in your browser of choice
with that said the ability to utlize startpages differs from browser to browser. in general the consesus seems to be
that browsers like firefox offers more flexibility in terms of customization for these things then for instance chrome. 
but with a plethora of browsers and extensions for each of them these startpages are useufll no matter what you choose
to work with as your browser of choice.

### what is in the project?

* `zt_original`:
this was the first project, it uses bootstrap and VanillaJS to display a collection of links in 4 different menus. simple but efficient, and easily customizable imo
